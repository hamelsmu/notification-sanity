    "## GitHub Notification Sanity With `ghapi`\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: I am part of lots of user groups on GitHub , and GitHub's notification filters are only so fine grained.  Anytime one of these groups are mentioned on GitHub, I get notified.  This results in a tremendous amount of notification spam for me.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can use [ghapi](https://ghapi.fast.ai/) to mark notifications that don't contain my handle as read en-masse.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `ghapi` to access authenticated operations (other than when running through GitHub Actions), you will need a GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), which is a secret code used to access your account. If you don't have one, [click here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) to create one. You'll be asked to enter a name -- choose anything you like, for instance \"*ghapi*\". You'll also be asked to choose \"scopes\"; this limits what you'll be able to do with the API using this token. If you're not sure, click \"*repo*\" \"*gist*\", \"*notifications*\", and \"*workflow*\". Then click \"Generate Token\" at the bottom of the screen, and copy the token (the long string of letters and numbers shown). You can easily do that by clicking the little clipboard icon next to the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than pasting that token into every script, it's easiest to save it as an environment variable. If you save it as `$GITHUB_TOKEN` then it will be most convenient, so add this to the end of your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    export GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx\n",
    "\n",
    "...replacing the `xxx` with the token you just copied. (Don't forget to `source` that file after you change it.), pass a [GitHub token].\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as your `token`, you can also pass any parameters you want auto-inserted into relevant methods, such as `owner` and `repo`:\n",
    "\n",
    "_The above instructions on authentication are also [available here](https://ghapi.fast.ai/)._\n"
